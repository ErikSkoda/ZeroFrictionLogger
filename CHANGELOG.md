## [0.9.0] - 2025-07-21
- unit test project including logger source code released on GitHub

## [0.9.3] - 2025-07-24
üß™ **Pre-release defect discovered**
- Unit testing exposed a defect directly **before going live**: all unit tests passed when running from source but some broke when running against the locally installed NuGet package.
- The `GetAppName()` method returned the **logger's own DLL name** instead of the **host app name**.

üõ†Ô∏è **Fix and design decision**
- `InitialiseErrorHandling` has been updated to accept the host app name.
- Host app devs can pass the app name explicitly using reflection or a string.
- If empty or null, the logger uses **four fallback mechanisms** to resolve the host app name:
1. `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()`
2. `Assembly.GetCallingAssembly()`
3. `Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(Environment.GetCommandLineArgs()[0])`
4. Fallback to hard coded expression: `"app"`

Each fallback is validated and skipped if the result:
- is `null`
- empty string
- contains `"dotnet"`, `"xunit"`, `"testhost"`, `"zerofrictionlogger"`, `"zilch"` or a `"."`

This approach combines **maximum developer control** with **sensible defaults**, without sacrifice to compatibility - dll or exe, Windows, Linux, MacOS, .NET 6/8+ and previous versions, Mono/Xamarin, Native AOT, Blazor etc.

üöß **No NuGet dll**
- When unit testing from source `GetAppName()` correctly returned `"TestLogger"` (unit test host app name)
- When unit testing against a locally installed packaged dll all fallbacks except the last one failed, returning `"app"`.
- Considered and rejected a 5th fall back - using host app installation folder name as proxy for app name.
- Unit testing fallbacks from source also revealed `FallBackEnvCmdLineArgsZero` returned `testhost` instead of `TestLogger`.

:pushpin: **Summary**
- Version 0.9.3 **will not be published on NuGet** as a packaged dll.
- Version 0.9.3 **full source code is shared on GitHub** for the sake of transparency
- *A solution favoring simple over clever is in the works.*

## [0.9.4] - 2025-07-26
üß™ **Fall back methods not working as intended**
The 0.9.3 fix worked to an extent: the reflection-based fall back methods for retrieving host app name introduced worked fine when running from source, but not when using the packaged dll. Only the fourth and final fall back - using the hard coded `"app"` worked reliably.

üõ†Ô∏è **Update and design decision**
Host app devs can still pass the host app name to `InitialiseErrorHandling`, either via reflection or as string. If the host app name passed is `null`, empty or contains `dotnet`, `xunit`, `testhost`, `zerofrictionlogger`, `zilch` or a `.` (period), the logger falls back to a single hardcoded value: `"app"`.

:pushpin: **Summary**
- *As host app dev you can pass the host app name to `InitialiseErrorHandling`, If not  the logger defaults to `"app"`.* This implementation values simple over clever while maximizing portability across `exe` and `dll` contexts, regardless of OS or platform - including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Mono/Xamarin, Native AOT, Blazor, Unity, etc. The library targets `.NETStandard2.1`.

## [0.9.5] - 2025-07-29
- As host app dev you can pass the host app name to `InitialiseErrorHandling`. If the passed app name is: `null`, `empty string` or contains `dotnet`, `xunit`, `testhost`,  `zerofrictionlogger`, `zilch` or `.`, then the logger defaults to `"app"`.

Deploying update to GitHub (14th) and NuGet (15th).

:arrows_counterclockwise: **Updates**

Log.cs
- provides **`retain-non-ISO-8601-utc-timestamp.txt`** marker file for backwards compatibility with version 1.0.0, facilitating users preferring the easier to read timestamps over the easier to automatically process ISO timestamps.
- adds **`LogTrace`** available by adding opt-in marker file **`use-trace.txt`** in the host app runtime folder
- adds support for timestamps in **milliseconds** by adding opt-in marker file **`use-millisec.txt`** in the host app runtime folder
- caps exception banner to 80 characters in console output
- sets fallback console encoding to UTF8 when logging to file is not possible
- adds null checks to `ExplicitlyRedactAndMarkValue`
- applies `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` for string formatting
- abbreviates some intellisense XML comments
- updates `LoggerVersion` to 1.1.0
- bugfix in 1.1.0 code base of error discovered while writing and reviewing CHANGELOG.md on GitHub, before deploying to NuGet. Not caught by Roslyn or unit tests.

PascalToSentence.cs
- Replaces magic numbers with named constants
- Replaces ToLower() and ToUpper() with ToLowerInvariant() and ToUpperInvariant()

TestSupport.cs
adds support functions:
- adds `LogFileContainsRegex` for checking timestamp formats
- adds `HandleExceptionWithoutStackTraceForTestingPurpose` which forces a division by zero triggering exception handling
- adds `UseUtc`, `UseLocalTime`, `AdoptIso8601UtcTimeStamp` `RetainNonIso8601UtcTimeStamp` `UseMilliSec` and `UseSec` for unit test readability
- bugfix in 1.1.0 code base of error discovered while writing and reviewing CHANGELOG.md on GitHub, before deploying to NuGet. Not caught by Roslyn or unit tests.

TestCases.cs
- increased number of unit tests from 90-ish to 115, covering all public-facing ZFL methods at least twice.

- updated `TestZeroFriction.sln` and `TestLogger.csproj` for running all unit tests after download from GitHub with app name `TestLogger`.
